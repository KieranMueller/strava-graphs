    <section class="section">Hey there! My name is Kieran Mueller, and I am a Full-Stack Software Developer from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
        Being quite active (hockey, cycling), I needed both a way to visualize my data, and create a new and exciting side project, Performance Graphs is just that! Included is a demo mode, 
        for users who may not have a Strava account yet, or are simply here to checkout the project. Thanks for visiting!
